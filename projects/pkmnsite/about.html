        <h2>About</h2>
            <div id="text">
                <p>This website it dedicated to helping aspiring pokemon trainers complete the National Pokedex! For now this site only has information on #001 - #030 and locations only form Gen VI.</p>
                
                <p>I made this website because of sites like Bulbapedia and Serebii had too much information to shift through to get what I wanted. All that is on this site is the pokemon in their National Dex order and where/how you can obtain them in Gen VI.</p>
                <p>The search features are not live yet either.</p>

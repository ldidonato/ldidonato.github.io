        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <div id="text">
                <p>So you want to catch 'em all? This website is a guide to completeing the Pokedex, and your journey begins here! The best way to do this is by making a Live Dex, that way you can carry on your work into future generations with Pokemon Bank. Keep in mind that with 720+ pokemon, you will need at least 25 exmpty PC boxes.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Catch all the pokemon you can in your current game, odds are there will only be around 60, they will make a nice starting point.</li>
                    <li>Rename your first box to "1-30" and your second to "31-60" and so on. Use the Completionist Dex Home Page as a reference.</li>
                    <li>Go through your starting pokemon, and sort them into the correct boxes. Order inside the box does not matter for now.</li>
                    <li>In the first box, sort all your pokemon into the correct order, leaving an empty space for your missing pokemon.</li>
                    <li>Begin the hunt! Use the Completionist Dex to find information on where you can obtain your first missing pokemon.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Trainer Tips:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep a ditto in the Day Care at all times. Place eggs in their empty spaces until you have 5 eggs ready to hatch, so you don't waste your time hatching only one egg. Use a pokemon with the Flame Body ability to hatch eggs faster.</li>
                    <li>Use the Elite Four to grind levels. Wait until you have 5 pokemon ready to evolve, then leading with a level 100 pokemon, wipe them out. Also remember to use Lucky Eggs to gain more experience. Give your leading mon the Amulet Coin if you need money.</li>
                    <li>Legendaries are the toughest to get. Your best choice is to wait for an event, or try to make trades on forums like Serebii. Don't use the GTS, there's nothing but hacked mons on there these days.</li>
                    <li>You can easily get evolution stones through Secret Super Training. Don't be afraid to use them up. See more on our evolution items page.</li>
                    <li>Other evolution items will cost you BP. If you're not a strong battler or don't like battling in the Battle Masion, just put tons of pokemon into Pokemon Bank. Open pokemon bank a few days later and it will give you the option of redeeming BP or PokeMiles.</li>
                </ul>

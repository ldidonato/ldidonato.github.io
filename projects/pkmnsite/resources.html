                <h3>Project 3 Requirements:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Completionist Dex logo created from scratch.</li>
                    <li>Embedded media is a YouTube video located on the "Events" page.</li>
                    <li>No secondary navigation</li>
                    <li>The first three in the first line of Menu Sprites on the homepage use a rollover image effect. Though it's bootstrap and not CSS.</li>
                    <li>JavaScript used was some Bootstrap from: <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#popovers">http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#popovers</a>. JavaScript was also used to make a hamburger dropdown menu while on mobile. The CSS and actual Scipt was taken from W3School.</li>
                    <li>I feel like I was able to achieve my original idea. I'm also very proud of the horizontal scroll box, and the mobile media queries. I feel like I could do a better job of making the logo an actual part of the website, rather than as a jpeg. It caused issues when the browser screen is resized.I also wish I had the time to put in all the hover information and the rest of the pokemon menu sprites.</li>

My first data has 4 levels with more than 2 options on the 4th level

Final choice is printed with "you have chosen" along with a picture

User can start over with restart button in top left

Form in the upper left asking or name and town, form ends an alert with information

Cookies is used to create "what you've been today"
localStorage is used to create and hold license

If a lower browser is used, page redirects to outdatedbrowser.com
There is nothing in the html

Each function in the javascript files are commented

javascript is used to grow and shrink the side bar tabs, with transitions

There is a favicon

I provided a second data set: data2.js to test with other data. It works as long as the format is the same. The only thing that breaks is the images, which makes sense.

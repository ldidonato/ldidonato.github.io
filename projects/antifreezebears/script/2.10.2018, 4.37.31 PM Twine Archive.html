[[Let&#39;s go!]]
[[Look Around.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Let&#39;s go!" tags="" position="582,275" size="100,100">Whoa there! Atalanta can’t forget her bear, Honey. Honey is an absolute must before going anywhere, they’re lucky.

[[Now can we go?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Now can we go?" tags="" position="620,413" size="100,100">Absolutely. With a quick kiss from Mom, Atalanta is out the door.
This school. Is. AMAZING. Atalanta is positive that she looks every bit of the freshman that she is, but she doesn’t care. She’s ogling the trophy cases, the principal pictures, the map of the school grounds, and anything else she can at the front entrance. Oh man, oh boy, she can’t decide what do do first!

[[Find her locker]]
[[Go to her first class]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Find her locker" tags="" position="451,567" size="100,100">Among the papers given to every Freshman student she finds the paper with her locker number on it.
&quot;Locker 2018&quot;
She heads to the locker. She finds it and enters the given combination &quot;3 2 0.&quot; Her locker is empty. She puts some spare books and her lunch in her locker.
Now its time to get to class if she doesn&#39;t want to be late. 
[[Take a look at her schedule]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Go to her first class" tags="" position="697,566" size="100,100">She should get to class. Don&#39;t want to be late, it might take her some time to get there especially since the building is new to her.
[[Take a look at her schedule]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Take a look at her schedule" tags="" position="549,714" size="100,100">Atalanta&#39;s schedule:

3. Spanish Room - 500
4. Lunch - Cafeteria
5. Global History 1 - Room 320

It seems like Atalanta has to go to English.
[[Go to English]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Go to English" tags="" position="549,864" size="100,100">The school is awesome but also a bit crowded and large. In the hallways full of rushing students, she gets a tad lost.

&quot;Hi! I&#39;m a little lost, can you help me find room 350?&quot;
A shortish guy with wild dark hair and a wide smile answers her:</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="Look Around." tags="" position="424,133" size="100,100">Atalanta is in her room.
